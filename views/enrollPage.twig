            Here you can generate a new client certificate to be installed in 
            your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following browsers and platforms were tested and are working:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firefox (Windows, Linux, Android)</li>
            <li>Chromium (Linux)</li>
            <li>Chrome (Windows, Android)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Press the "Generate" button below to start the certificate generation process.
        </p>
            After this has completed you should get a notification by your browser that a
            client certificate was successfully installed.
        </p>

                After the certificate is successfully installed you can continue the login
                process by clicking <a href="{{ referrer|e }}">here</a>.
            {% else %}
